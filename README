	IMYWA is a project for create database web applications based on stored procedures.
	
	It is a simple php framework that based in some data definitions and a set of actions on
these data definitions, generates dynamically the html forms to show the detail data in some
formats, and calls the mysql store procedures asociated with the actions.

	Currently, this is a in house project used for prototype and internal entreprise data 
applications. I want to public this project to acknoledge and to support the comunity effort.
Effort that have bring us many usefull and essential projects. (No this one).

	We use the fpdf library created by Olivier PLATHEY, and integrated on this project. You
can get the original code at http://www.fpdf.org.
